 <h3>1. Topological quantum materials</h3>

  <p class="justify">
    We explore the frontier where topology intersects with electron correlations in low-dimensional quantum materials and van der Waals heterostructures. By tuning electrostatic gating, layer stacking, twist angle, and proximity to ferromagnets or superconductors, we create and probe new quantum states arising from the interplay of symmetry, topology, electron interactions, and lattice instabilities. Our goal is to uncover novel topological and correlated phases and to advance the understanding and control of emergent phenomena in a series of new quantum materials.

    For instance, we recently discovered a <em>dual quantum spin Hall insulator</em> in monolayer TaIrTe<sub>4</sub>
    (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07211-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Nature</em> <b>628</b>, 515, 2024</a>),
    arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations close to low-energy van Hove singularities. The discovery of the dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating topological flat minibands through CDW superlattices, which offer a promising platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases. Moreover, we further uncovered the
    <em>interaction-driven topological phase transition</em>
    (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv:2506.18412</a>)
    from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial insulator, a higher-order topological insulator, and a metallic phase. More recently, by leveraging second-order nonlinear Hall transport as a probe of quantum geometry, the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole of these systems have been systematically investigated.

  <h3>2. Topological quantum materials</h3>
  <p class="justify">
  Atomically thin 2D materials are promising candidates for next-generation integrated electronics owing to their exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. However, several critical challenges must be addressed before practical deployment, including material quality, contact engineering, device performance, device scaling and scalable fabrication, as well as power consumption.
  </p>
  
  <p class="justify">
  We have achieved controllable epitaxial growth of high-quality MoS<sub>2</sub> wafers by chemical vapor deposition, featuring domain sizes exceeding 100 μm, excellent crystalline quality, tunable layer numbers (1L–3L) and stacking configurations, as well as controlled oxygen doping (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Nano Lett.</em> 2020</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202004276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Small</em> 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwac077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Natl. Sci. Rev.</em> 2022</a>). Building on this materials platform, we developed an ultrathin high-<em>κ</em> dielectric deposition technique (5 nm HfO<sub>2</sub> with an equivalent oxide thickness of ~1 nm) and realized ohmic contacts with atomically sharp interfaces (<em>R</em><sub>c</sub> < 0.6 kΩ·μm). These advances enabled the fabrication of high-performance MoS<sub>2</sub> thin-film transistors and large-scale flexible integrated logic circuits operating at low voltages (~0.5 V) and low power consumption (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39390-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Nature Commun.</em> 2023</a>). Collectively, these achievements represent a significant step toward the practical application of 2D electronics.
  </p>
  
  <p class="justify">
  Leveraging this well-established growth expertise, our next objective is to develop controllable synthesis methods for the 1<em>T</em>′-phase of MX<sub>2</sub> (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) transition metal dichalcogenides. Understanding the mechanisms governing phase control in these materials and exploring their topological electronic properties are essential for advancing both fundamental physics and future quantum device applications.
