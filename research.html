  <h2>Research Directions</h2>

  <h3>1. Low-dimensional quantum materials: topology and electron correlated phases</h3>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    We explore the frontier where topology intersects with electron correlations in low-dimensional quantum materials and vdW heterostructures. By tuning electrostatic gating, layer stacking, twist angle, and proximity to ferromagnets or superconductors, we create and probe new quantum states arising from the interplay of symmetry, topology, and electron interactions. Our goal is to uncover novel topological and correlated phases and to advance the understanding and control of emergent phenomena in quantum materials.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    For instance, we recently discover a <em>dual quantum spin Hall insulator</em> in monolayer TaIrTe4, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations close to low energy van Hove singularities. Moreover, we further uncover the <em>interaction-driven topological phase transition</em> from quantum spin Hall insulator to trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase. More recently, by leveraging second-order nonlinear Hall transport as a probe of quantum geometry, the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole of these systems have been systematically investigated.
